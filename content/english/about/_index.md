You might know me by my handle, Zyrridian. I’m someone who enjoys exploring tech—whether it's mobile development with Kotlin or Flutter, trying out web development (though I'm still learning), or working on simple projects like a restaurant/cashier management system in VB.NET. As for game development? That’s something I only do when I’ve got a lot of free time to waste—just for fun.

I tend to jump between projects and ocassionally get sidetracked by new programming languages, but I always find my way back to native Kotlin mobile development. I've also had my fair share of frustration with JavaScript frameworks—there’s always a new one, and the options can feel endless.

Outside of coding, I write blogs—usually about tech, but sometimes I write about whatever comes to mind. I also make music from time to time (not great at it, but it’s fun) and sometimes mess around with video editing.

That’s me—just figuring things out and experimenting with something!
