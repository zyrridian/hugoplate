### Mentalys App

Mentalys stands for Mental Analysis. It was the capstone project for my team in the Bangkit Academy 2024 Batch 2 program. We collaborated with the Cloud Computing and Machine Learning teams to build this app. My role was Android development. The appâ€™s main feature is mental health analysis, which includes three methods: a questionnaire, voice tone analysis, and handwriting pattern recognition. Users receive insights about their mental health results and AI-powered recommendations via the Gemini AI API.

For users with indications of mental health issues, the app provides access to professional help through a consultation page and nearby offline clinics. Additional features include a mental health articles section, mental health history tracking, and personalized profile authentication.
